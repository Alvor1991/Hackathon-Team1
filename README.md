## The Hackathon

A hackathon is an event, generally lasting a few days, where teams of programmers, designers, and developers collaborate intensively to build software or hardware projects. Participants often work on solving specific challenges or developing new ideas within a set timeframe. Hackathons encourage innovation, teamwork, and creative problem-solving, with the goal of producing functional prototypes or solutions by the event's end.

This months Hackathon is focused on the theme of music in recognition of September being Classical Music month.

The goals of the hackathon are to create one of the following projects:

- Build a digital Instrument
- Build a music game
- Build a music learning app

The judging criteria is as follows:

- The project is one of the three suggested apps
- The project goes above and beyond the given project ideas
- The project has a big focus on UX/UI
- The project has a basic readme
- The project is well planned and executed

## Our Project

We decided to create a theremin for our hackathon project because it represents an innovative, hands-on way to blend technology and music. The theremin is unique as it's one of the few instruments played without physical contact, making it an interesting challenge to build. It allowed us to explore principles of electronics, sensor-based input, and creative coding, all while creating something interactive and fun to demonstrate.

Additionally, it allowed us to be creative in developing visuals to go along side and support the interactivity of our app. We chose Three.js for the background visuals in our theremin app because it's a powerful and lightweight JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics in the browser. It allows for real-time rendering of dynamic visuals, which pairs well with the interactive nature of the theremin. Three.js also offers a wide range of tools and flexibility, making it easy to create visually engaging and responsive backgrounds that can react to the music and movements of the theremin.

## Instructions

A theremin is a very simple to use yet difficult to master intrument. By simply clicking anywhere on the screen the user will create a note relative to the cursor position. The pitch and volume of the note is dependent on the x and y position values of the cursor at any given time. Simply move the cursor up to increase volume and down to decrease volume, similarly, to increase pitch the user can simply move their cursor to the right of the screen and left to decrease pitch, resulting in a bassier tone.
